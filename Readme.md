# JS Learning Repository

This repository is a **compilation of very small projects** that showcase my **gradual learning and applied knowledge** in JavaScript. Each project reflects a concept or skill Iâ€™ve picked up along the way.

## What's Inside
- Basic JavaScript exercises
- DOM manipulation projects (mini quiz)
- API integration tests
- Small algorithm implementations
- And more as I continue to learn!

## Purpose
This repo serves as a personal journey log, showing how Iâ€™m building my JavaScript skills **step by step**. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
